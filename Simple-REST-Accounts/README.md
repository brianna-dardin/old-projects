# Simple REST Accounts
As the name implies, this is a simple REST API Salesforce project. I created an Apex web service class (and its unit test class) that returns a list of accounts and their contacts. Then I created two different versions of the list - a Visualforce page and a PHP page. In the Visualforce page, I used the AJAX toolkit and the session ID to call the web service. In PHP, I used OAuth and my username and password (not included here obviously) as well as cURL. Finally I used jQuery Mobile to style the pages.
